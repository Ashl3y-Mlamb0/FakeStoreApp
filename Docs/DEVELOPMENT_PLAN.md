### Supabase Database Setup
To set up the required database for the authentication and data persistence features:

1. Log in to the Supabase dashboard (https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Select your project with URL: https://qocwdnjtfvjaqtijdpqz.supabase.co
3. Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Create a new query and paste the complete schema from `src/services/supabase/schema.sql`
5. Run the SQL script to create:
   - Profiles table to extend user data
   - Orders table for tracking purchases
   - Order Items table for order details
   - Favorites table for user product preferences
   - Row Level Security policies for data protection
   - Triggers for automatic profile creation

6. Configure Authentication settings:
   - Go to "Authentication" â†’ "Providers"
   - Ensure "Email" provider is enabled
   - For development, consider disabling email confirmations

7. Test the database setup:
   - Create a test user through the sign-up screen
   - Verify profile creation in the "Tables" section
   - Test order creation through the checkout process
   - Confirm data isolation between different user accounts

### Additional Requirements
- [ ] Switch from public API to Fake Store Server
- [ ] Implement all 9 distinct screens
- [ ] Ensure proper state persistence
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states

### Submission Requirements
- [ ] GitHub repository URL
- [ ] Demo video (â‰¤ 8 minutes)
- [ ] Screenshots of all screens
- [ ] Optional: reflection document
